<h3>Job Shop Scheduling</h3>
<p>
    A simple job shop consists of a set of different machines that process
    jobs. Each job consists of series of tasks that must be completed in 
    specified order on the machines. The problem is to schedule the jobs on
    the machines to minimize makespan.

<p>
    Data consists of two tables. The first table is decomposition of the jobs
    into a series of tasks. Each task lists a job name, name of the required
    machine, and task duration.  The second table list task pairs where the 
    first task must be completed before the second task can be started. This
    formulation is quite general, but can also specify situations with no
    feasible solutions.
