<h3>Data Reconciliation and Gross Error Detection</h3>
<p>
    The following demonstration was motivated by a former student Matt N. 
    who was exploring methods for assessing measurement information in a
    refinery application. The illustration was adapted from Chapter 1 of 
    "Reconciliation & Gross Error Detection: An Intelligent Use of Process
    Data" by Shankar Narasimhan and Cornelius Jordache (Gulf Publishing,
    2000).

    The flow sheet is labeled by s/k pairs which refer to stream s and 
    measurement k. Streams are numbered s in 1..S and sensors are numbered 
    k in 1..K. The parameter s[k] denotes the stream associated with 
    measurement k.

    Given sensor measurements \(y_k\), the task is to infer values for the
    flowrates \(x_{s_k}\) using mass balance equations and a sensor model
    \[\begin{eqnarray}
     |y_k-x_{s_k}| & \leq & e_k + M g_k \\
     |e_k| & \leq & e^{max}_k
    \end{eqnarray}\]
    \(g_k\) is a binary variable indicating the presence of a gross error 
    in sensor \(k\). \(M\) is a big number. A gross error occurs if the 
    measured data is not consistent with sensor model and mass balances. 
    The optimization objective is to find an estimate of mass flows 
    minimizing the number of gross sensor errors.
