<h3>The Newsvendor Problem</h3>
<p>
    The newsvendor problem is a two stage decision problem with recourse. The 
    vendor needs to decide how much inventory to order today to fulfill an 
    uncertain demand. The data includes the unit cost, price, and salvage value of 
    the product being sold, and a probabilistic forecast of demand. The objective 
    is to maximize expected profit.

    As shown in lecture, this problem can be solved with a plot, and the solution
    interpreted in terms of a cumulative probability distribution. The advantage
    of a MathProg model is that additional constraints or other criteria may be 
    considered, such as risk aversion.</p>

    There is an extensive literature on the newsvendor problem which has been 
    studied since at least 1888. See
