<h3>Project Management with the Critical Path Method</h3>
<p>
    The Critical Path Method is a technique for calculating the shortest time span 
    needed to complete a series of tasks. The tasks are represented by nodes, each 
    labelled with the duration. The precedence order of the task is given by a set 
    of arcs.
</p>
<p>
    Here we demonstrate the representation and calculation of the critical path. 
    Decision variables are introduced for
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Earliest Start</li>
    <li> Earliest Finish</li>
    <li> Latest Start</li>
    <li> Latest Finish</li>
    <li> Slack = Earliest Finish - Earliest Start = Latest Finish - Earliest
         Finish</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Tasks on the Critical Path have zero slack.
