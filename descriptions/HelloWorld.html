<h3>Hello, World</h3>
<p>
    This is among hte simplest MathProg models one can write. The
    <tt>printf</tt> statement demonstrates how to print information to the 
    model output. Note the use of \n to separate lines of output.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> The first statement is a comment. MathProg ignores everything on a 
         line following a hash tag<tt>#</tt>.</li>
    <li> Every statement ends with a semicolon <tt>;</tt></li>
    <li> The end of model is indicated by the <tt>end;</tt> statement.</li>
    <li> There is a final new line following the <tt>end</tt> statement. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Experiment with this simple file. Try adding addition lines of
    output including blank lines. See what happens if you leave out a
    needed semicolon or the final <tt>end;</tt> statement.
