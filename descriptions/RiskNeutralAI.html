<h3>Risk Neutral Analysis for American Idol</h3>
<p>
    American Idol is a U.S. based televised singing competition in
    which the audience votes for their favorite contestant in the
    final rounds. Each week the contestant with the lowest votes
    is dropped until a winner emerges in the last week. The 
    intense interest in the singing competition has attracted
    the attention of third-party agents who offer an opportunity
    to bet on the eventual winner. Here we analyze a sample of the
    betting market to show just how bad an 'investment' it can be.

    A typical betting agent will quote the payout for a $100
    on a particular contestant. Label the agent \(a\), the contestant
    \(c\), and the face value of the corresponding bet \(P_{c,a}(0)\) 
    (in this case $100). Let \(x_{c,a}\) denote the number of bets an
    investor places on contestant \(c\) with agent \(a\). The total
    cost to the investor is then
    \[w(0)=\sum_{c\in\cal{C}}\sum_{a\in\cal{A}}P_{c,a}(0)x_{c,a}\]
    The payout of a bet with agent \(a\) at the end of the contest is
    \(P_{c,a}(1)\) if contestant \(c\) wins, otherwise the payout is 
    zero.

    A risk neutral investor seeks a betting strategy offering a
    risk-free return under all outcomes, that is
    \[\sum_{a\in\cal{A}}P_{c,a}(1)x_{c,a} \geq (1+r_f)w(0) \qquad 
    \forall c\in\cal{C} \]
    where \(r_f\) is the risk free return. Later we'll see that
    betting agents prefer to keep profits to themselves, and that
    the maximum value for \(r_f\) is generally negative. That will
    be the unavoidable cost of participating in the betting markets.

    Substitution yields
    \[(1+r_f)\sum_{c\in\cal{C}}\sum_{a\in\cal{A}}P_{c,a}(0)x_{c,a} 
    - \sum_{a\in\cal{A}}P_{c,a}(1)x_{c,a} \leq 0 \qquad \forall 
    c\in\cal{C}\]
    Gordan's theorem (a version of Farka's lemma) tells us either
    \(Ax < 0\) has a solution \(x\) or else \(y^TA = 0\) has a solution
    \(y\geq 0\).
