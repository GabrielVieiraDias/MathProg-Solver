<h3>Solving a System of Linear Equations</h3>
<p>
    MathProg is a language for describing linear and discrete optimization problems.
    Whether or not you have heard that terminology before you are already
    familiar with some of the basics. This series of exercises will introduce
    MathProg by demonstrating its use in familiar situations.
<p>
</p>
    Consider a set of three linear equations
    \[\begin{align}
        2x + y + z = & 12 \\
         x + 2y + z = & 23 \\
         x + y + z = & 10 
    \end{align}\]
    in the three unknowns \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
</p>
<p>
    To find a solution with MathProg
    you need to create a description of the problem.
    For this case the description consists of: (1) a description of the variables, 
    (2) a description of
    the equations, (3) additional keywords indicating the desired actions, and (4)
    comments necessary for someone to understand the description. These 
    points are demonstrated in the MathProg model shown below.

<pp>
    Note the following points as you examine this model &mdash;
    <ul>
        <li> The hashtags denote comments. Anything following the hashtag on the 
             same line is ignored by MathProg.</li>
        <li> Semicolons separate statements in MathProg. A MathProg statement may continue
             over several lines.</li>
        <li> The statements starting with the keyword <tt>var</tt> 
             describe variables appearing in the
             problem. There is a separate line for each variable.</li>
        <li> The next group of statements describe equations appearing in the
             problem. Each statement begins with a name of an equation separated by
             a colon from the equation itself. The equations are written in standard
             computer notation. Each equation must have a name.</li>
        <li> The keyword <tt>solve</tt> indicates a solution is to be computed.</li>
        <li> The keyword <tt>end</tt> indicates completion of the problem description.</li>
    </ul>

    Here are a few exercises to try &mdash;

<pp>
    <ol>
        <li> Click the Solve button underneath the editor. 
             Locate the solution for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in the tab labeled 'Variables'.
             In the constraints tab locate the solution for each equation.</li>
        <li> Change the equations. Explore how the solution
             changes depends on equation parameters. See what happens when
             two of the equations are identical.</li>
        <li> The Wikipedia page
             <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations">
             Systems of Linear Equations</a> showes some example problems. Click Clear All, 
             then write a MathProg model from scratch to solve one of the examples.</li>
