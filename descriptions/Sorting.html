<h3>Sorting in MathProg</h3>
<p>
    MathProg is a lean language with a limited number of functions and 
    utilities. Demonstrated below  are several techniques for sorting sets 
    by value of parameters or decision variables. These techniques may be 
    useful in other contexts.

    These ideas are attributable to xypron and Andrew Makhorin on the 
    help-glpk mail list.
