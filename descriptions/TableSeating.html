<h3>Table Seating</h3>
<p>
    Problem from the lp_solve listserv, January 12, 2013

<p>
    I am trying write an integer program to solve the following problem. There are 3n
    people, who are denoted {a,b,c,...}. There are n tables and 3 people must sit at 
    each table. There is a value associated with each pair sitting at the same table.
    Person a and person b sitting together is represented by a binary variable
    a_b and the value of them sitting together is vab.
</p>
<p>
    I want find an allocation of people to tables that maximizes the sum of these values,
    that is max:+vab*a_b+vac*a_c+vad*a_d+....
</p>
