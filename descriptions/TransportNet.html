<h3>Transportation Network</h3>
<p>
    This is a simple model to demonstrate modeling of a transportation 
    network for a system with sources and destinations. The given supply and
    demand constraints, the objective is to minimize transportation costs. 
    This model demonstrates:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Transportation optimization.</li>
    <li> Factoring of applications into separate modeling and data sections.</li>
    <li> Use of defaults and defining sets in the data section.</li>
</ol>
