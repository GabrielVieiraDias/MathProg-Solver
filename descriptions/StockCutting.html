<h3>Stock Cutting</h3>
<p>
    The stock cutting problem is to minimize the waste
    associated with cutting up stock materials to produce a set of products. 
    Examples of the one dimensional problem include cutting lengths
    of steel bar into a set of products, cutting wide paper rolls into smaller ones,
    and cutting dimensioned lumber to meet the production
    needs of furniture shops.

    In large scale applications the stock cutting problem begins with a
    base set of cutting patterns. Each cutting pattern breaks a piece of stock into
    a set of products. The base calculation is to find a mix of
    cutting patterns to meet product requirements. A secondary problem is 
    solved to find additional cutting patterns with the potential to reduce
    costs. The solution then proceeds iteratively with new patterns are 
    generated 'on the fly' coupled with a branch and bound search to find
    an optimal solution. This approach is called 'column generation.'

    As demonstrated below, for small scale problems the stock cutting
    problem can be formulated as an assignment of product pieces to stock pieces.
    For this example the data consists of a list of product
    types, lengths and demand.
    The example incorporates multiple types of raw materials. The objective
    is to maximize the number of pieces of stock material that are left uncut.

    An aspect of this problem is the high degree of solution 
    symmetry. The number of
    equivalent solutions is a combinatorial function of the number of identical
    pieces of raw of materials. In these cases a solver may quickly find a 
    solution but then need to search many equivalent solutions to verify
    optimality. This example uses a weighted objective to 
    separate otherwise equivalent solutions.

    To repeat, this approach will not work for larger problems due to the 
    excessive number of binary variables required and high degree of solution 
    symmetry. Consult the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cspsol/">cspsol project</a> 
    for a solution method using column generation and glpk api.
