<h3>Portfolio Optimization using Mean Absolute Deviation</h3>
<p>
    Konno and Yamazaki (1990) proposed a linear programming model for
    portfolio optimization in which the risk measure is mean absolute 
    deviation (MAD). This model computes a portfolio minimizing MAD subject 
    to a lower bound on return.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast to the classical Markowitz portfolio, the MAD criterion 
    requires a data set consisting of returns on the investment assets. The
    data set may be an historical record or samples from a multivariate 
    statistical model of portfolio returns.  The MAD criterion produces 
    portfolios with properties not shared by the Markowitz portfolio, 
    including second degree stochastic dominance.
</p>
<p>
    Below we demonstrate portfolio optimization with the MAD criterion where 
    data is generated by sampling a multivariate normal distribution. Given 
    mean return \(r\) and the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix
    \(\Sigma\) (i.e., \(C\) such that \(CC^T = \Sigma\) ), we compute
    \(r_t = r + C z_t\) where the elements of \(z_t\) are zero mean normal 
    variates with unit variance.
</p>

    The rest of the formulation is adapted from "Optimization Methods in Finance"
    by Gerald Curnuejols and Reha Tutuncu (2007) which, in turn, follows an
    implementation due to Fienstein and Thapa (1993). A complete tutorial on
    the implementation of this model is available on GLPK wikibook.
