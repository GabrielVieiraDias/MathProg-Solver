<h3>Jesuit Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>
    The following problem was formulated by Tomas C. (ND '09) who was 
    working with the Jesuit Volunteer Corp in 2009-2010. Here was his 
    problem:
</p>
<blockquote>
    There are 7 of us in the house. We have broken down the chores into 4 
    major sections: 1) Kitchen, 2) Bathroom, 3) Common Area, 4) Trash. The 
    trash is the only task that needs only one person to accomplish, the 
    other 3 tasks have 2 people assigned to them. Each person needs to rotate
    through each task twice and the trash only once. The assignments rotate 
    each week. Each person needs to have a new partner each week and no 
    person can have more than one task in a week.
</blockquote>
<p>
    In the formulation below we require every possible pair to do at least
    one task together. This is different that requiring a new partner each 
    week, but Tomas said later that this would meet their needs.

<p>
    This a challenging computation, depending
    on your computer this may take a few seconds to a few minutes.
