<h3>Mathematical Programming in GNU MathProg</h3>
<p>
    GNU MathProg (part of the open source GNU GLPK project) is a modeling 
    language for describing linear and discrete optimization problems. Use 
    this page to create and solve MathProg models using the 
    <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/hgourvest/glpk.js'>glpk.js</a>
    solver. Start by selecting an example from the Examples menu, opening a 
    model from your computer or cloud storage, or creating your model from scratch.
