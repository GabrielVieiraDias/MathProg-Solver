<h3>Linear Program in Two Variables</h3>
<p>
    Write a MathProg model to find the maximum value of \(z=3x + 4y\ \ \) 
    subject to the following set of constraints
    \[\begin{align}
        x + 2y & \leq 14 \\
        3x - y & \geq 0 \\
        x - y & \leq 2
    \end{align}\]
    The maximum value of \(z\) is 34.  What are the corresponding values of 
    \(x\) and \(y\)? What is the minimum value of \(z\)?
</p>
