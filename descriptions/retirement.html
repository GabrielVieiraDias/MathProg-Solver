    <p>
        Retirement savings is an often neglected priority in personal finance. This model
        demonstrates the computation of a simple savings plan over a professional career
        that accommodates several major expenditures in addition to meeting a savings target
        equal to eight times salary at retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The model assumes a constant
        rate of inflation <span class="math">\(r_f\)</span>, a constant rate of
        return on investments <span class="math">\(r_i\)</span>, and a salary model
        <span class="math">\[S_k = \frac{(1+r_f)^k (\alpha + \beta k)}{1 + \beta k}S_{\infty}\]</span>
        where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> denotes year, <span class="math">\(S_{\infty}\)</span>
        the ultimate salary, <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the starting salary as
        a fraction of the ultimate salary, and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is a
        constant with units of inverse time reflecting the relative speed of career growth.
        Examples of additional expenses is a provision to cover the college tuition expenses
        of several children.
    </p>
    <p>
        The optimization objective is to determine a bound on the fraction of salary that 
        needs to be saved to meet the projected expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
        An interesting exercise is to modify the model to include other expenses typical of
        a professional career, such as the purchase of real estate, and the management of
        personal debt. But be careful not to read too much into the results of this type of
        modeling. This model is deterministic while real life is not!
